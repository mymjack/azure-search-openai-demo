 Why do people buy insurance in the first place?
 

  
 

 It depends on what is happening in their life. They’ve bought a home,
                        landed a new job, had children, or got married, and they want to protect what matters most.
                    
 

 

 

 How much life insurance is enough?
 

  
 

 It depends on who you ask. To ensure their funeral expenses and debt are covered and their
                        dependants are supported financially, the average married Canadian parent believes they need
                        more than $300,000 in   Life Insurance .
                        Meanwhile, single Canadians feel their needs are
                        closer to $190,000

 When do people feel it’s the ‘right time’ to buy   life insurance ?
                    
 

  
 

 It depends on what is driving the purchase. For the majority of Canadians (63 per cent), the
                        best time to buy is as soon as they can afford it, so they can take advantage of low premium
                        rates
